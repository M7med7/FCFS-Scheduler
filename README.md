Input Process Information:

    When prompted, enter:
        Number of Processes: Total processes you want to schedule.
        For each process:
            Arrival Time: The time when the process arrives.
            Burst Time: The time required for the process to complete execution.

Output:

    The program will display:
        Waiting Time for each process.
        Turnaround Time for each process.
        Average Waiting Time and Average Turnaround Time across all processes.

Process Execution Simulation:

    A simple simulation shows the waiting and turnaround times for each process, helping visualize the FCFS scheduling flow.
